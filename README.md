# Yolov8-on-ArgoverseHD-Object-Detection-
we will dive deeper into the experimental setup, highlighting the key steps involved in training and evaluating the YOLOv8s and YOLOv8m models on the Argoversehd dataset. We will discuss the training process, including data preparation, model configuration of YOLOv8 in the context of object detection on the Argoversehd dataset.
